## Recommendation

If you're looking for someone to build or lead a team of engineers as they face interesting technical challenges in build a successful product focused business while realizing valuable personal and professional goals, then you should talk to Anthony, now.

## What is your most memorable accomplishment together

With Anthony's insightful leadership and steadfast support we took on the task of bringing the live classroom experience offered at Lingo Live in house. We replaced third party offerings like Slack and Google hangouts while refocusing the experience away from raw video conferencing to position the software to more uniquely support the challenges of learning the skills of language and communication skills. 

## Biggest Strengths

- decomposing complex technical requirements
- setting attainable work goals across teams of varied experience and technical specialty
- supporting the personal and professional growth of his direct reports
- representing technical and product realities to the company at large
- gathering support and drive consensus on important technical and product directives

## Biggest Weaknesses

Anthony will do just about anything to ensure his team/company moves in a productive direction, even if that means he has to take on too much responsibility himself. This comes from both a strong sense of duty, but also his broad and growing skill set, however it can also come with a difficulty to admit when enough is enough and he's really doing three or four jobs at a time. This can cycle around to a similar, and sometimes worse, situation than he had originally hoped to solve.

## Advice for future employers

Anthony pairs well with strong product leadership and a collaborative environment that ensures a clear yet flexible vision. Serve that with the freedom for him to bring together the required technical team and he will bring your dreams to life.

## What type of work environment do you think Anthony will most likely thrive in?

Anthony gets a lot of energy from working with other highly creative and talented team members. This energy is put to the best use in serving a relatable group of end users via technical solutions brought to life by engineers with a desire to grow both in their career and their technical skills.

## Would you work with/for Anthony again?

Without question. Anthony's crystal clear focus on supporting the members of his teams become their best selves both as engineers/employees as well as people in general had such a positive effect on my career when working together at Lingo Live that I'd relish the opportunity to be in the sort of technical environment again.
